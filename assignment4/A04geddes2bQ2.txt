The convolutional layer added between A03 and A04 causes the model to achieve a 
higher overall accuracy and lower loss than the network without but has the 
effect of increasing training time because the network has to apply filters 
to each image in the training set. The accuracy of the network increased by 
~5% (from ~90% to ~95%) but the training time increased from ~15s/epoch to 
120s/epoch.

The accuracy is increased when using the convolutional layers because the 
convolution operation is able to extract secondary features from the data
such as position of pixels in relation to other pixels. In the MNIST set,
handwritten digits are classified and both position of pixels and grouping of 
pixels is important.
